<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr />

<h3>The Matrix Trilogy</h3>
    <p>The story, fight scenes, special effects, and use of slow-motion are unparalleled.</p>
<h3>The Fast and the Furious Saga</h3>
    <p>Great movies that portray the car underworld from the 90s to present time.
        Interesting character development and awaesome showcase of cars, racing scenes, and driving skills.</p>
<h3>Resident Evil Series (Live-action and animated)</h3>
    <p>Being a fan of the old and new games, I truly enjoyed all adaptations of the series.
        Seeing all the famous characters, villains, and enemies portrayed outside of the game environment is pretty cool.</p>
