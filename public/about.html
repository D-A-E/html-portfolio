<h1>About Me</h1>
<hr/>

<p>My name is Dae and I am a US Citizen/Canadian Permanent Resident living in beautiful British Columbia with my family.
  We moved to B.C. from Toronto, Ontario for a fresh start and to enjoy the same kind of lifestyle we had living in California - 
  beaches and mountains, all within a short driving distance from the city.
</p>

<p>I am an aspiring Software Engineer with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. Currently I am upgrading my coding skills
  to prepare myself for interviews and to finally land my first software engineering job.
</p>

<h3>My passions in life are:</h3>
  <p>Music - I can play musical instruments (acoustic/electric guitar, bass, piano/keyboard, and drums) and used to play in a band 
    at popular venues such as Exchange L.A.</p>
  <p>Cars - I consider myself a car enthusiast from a young age. Playing video games like Gran Turismo and Need for Speed 
    has greatly influenced my appreciation for cars, most especially JDM or Japanese Domestic Market cars from the 90s-2000s era. 
    My last project car was a 2007 Subaru Impreza WRX STi in rare Satin White Pearl colour and Rose Gold/Bronze factory BBS wheels.</p>
  <p>Video Games - I started playing video games at an early age of 2 and for most of my childhood I turned to video games both as a 
    comforting activity and a coping mechanism. My character was slowly developed by the sheer number and the type/amount of games 
    that I played which resulted in the enhancement of my motor skills, eye-hand coordination, memory, and problem-solving skills to 
    name a few. I still play to this day, no longer by myself but with my family as a form of relaxation/entertainment.</p>
